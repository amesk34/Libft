# Libft
Welcome to my first project at 1337 School (42 Network). This project is about coding a C library of standard functions from scratch. Through Libft, I reimplemented essential functions from the C standard library, as well as other utility functions that I will use throughout the 42 cursus.

Project Description :
The goal of this project is to build a custom static library (libft.a) containing functions that mimic and enhance parts of the C standard library. It is meant to deepen understanding of:

Memory management

String manipulation

Linked list operations

Function pointers

Code structure and clean programming practices

This foundational project will be reused in later projects at 42, making it an essential tool in my development journey.
